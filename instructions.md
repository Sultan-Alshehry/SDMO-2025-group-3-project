# Project Instructions

## General instructions

- Clean and modular code.
- Formal and professional writing.
- Each member should create and write to their "diary" in the diaries directory where they explain
what they did, why, and their thought process. This will be used later in the project report.
- If anyone need help with their work they should ask in the group-chat, we'll be happy to help

local clone (clone is prefered)
