the program itself contains many false positives and it doesn't really matter setting the threshold higher as it doesn't reduce the amount almost at all. 
And from what I've seen the program compares the similarity between the devs using matching names and emails and they could be very similiar, yet different 
and this would fall into the category that they are the same developer even though they are not.
