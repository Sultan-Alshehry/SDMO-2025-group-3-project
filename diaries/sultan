From what I have seen the output of the program contained many false positives,
I believe this is because the logic for processing first and last names is
insufficient. Some problems that I have noticed are:

1. There are no measures to ensure that a last name exists before searching for
it in the prefix, causing it to always be true if there is no last name.

2. Extremely short first and last names with only one letter for example are extremely more
to falsely detect a duplicate. Affected rules: 4, 5, 6, 7
